## üìù Description
A command line Content Management System (CMS) interface that allows users to interact with and manipulate information sorted in a database. The aim of this project is to demonstrate my understanding of MySQL as well as improve my knowledge of Inquirer and node.js. I was also able to understand how relational databases operate and how to provide an intuitive way of storing and accessing structured information that improves scalability, simplicity and data accuracy.
